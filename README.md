Personal finance tracker web application developed by Ritesh Ramesh(myself)
I have used a login page for easy sign up and a register tab for new users
There are multiple sections in the web application like expense history,income history,data visualization,action items,settings and log out
In the application u can add expenses or income,each of them will be stored seperately
A data visulisation feature is also available which shows the various categories of expenses in the form of a pie chart
A total balace indicator that can convert from INR to USD in just a click
CRUD operations to save,edit or delete any existing expense or income
A export featire that can help u export all your expenses in a pdf format
This web application is a dynamic webiste so it can we used on your mobile too with the best resolution
An action item tab that shows u can set reminders or alets on spending limits,thus keeping u in line of your expenses
